    I developed this app to enhance my programming skills, allowing users to effortlessly create and manage multiple participant lists.
    Users can easily add, remove, and edit names to keep lists up-to-date.
    The app ensures equal chances for each participant to be randomly selected with a single tap, making it ideal for picking winners or assigning tasks.
    Its structure is divided into 4 components:

      As for its deployment, I used the following Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services:
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Google Run: </span> for the dockerized apps Spring and Quarkus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Instance SQL: </span> with postgres.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Cloud Storage Buckets: </span> for the Angular static files
